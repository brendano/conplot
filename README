conplot - console plotter via ascii art

Brendan O'Connor - brenocon@gmail.com - http://github.com/brendano/conplot

conplot is a script for when you have a file or stream of lots of numbers and
want to look at it fast.  Needs many more features, but basics work.

Usage: pipe a column of numbers on stdin to conplot.rb.  Tries to be smart
about other junk in the file.  It is intended to work with shell tools like
perl -pe, awk/sed, wc, du, sort|uniq -c and the like.

Example: time.log is a big list of numbers from a (while sleep 1; do du -m db;
done) loop.  I want to know how fast the db is growing over time.


$ wc -l time.log
   77879 time.log

$ head -2 time.log
35      db
36      db

$ tail -2 time.log
14540   db
14540   db

$ cat time.log | conplot

Features to do, that probably will never get done
 * scatterplots!!!  x,y as two columns on stdin.  almost already supported.
 * size according to terminal size (e.g. look at stty -a)
 * histograms should be integrated as an option -- or, use github.com/stevej/conhist
